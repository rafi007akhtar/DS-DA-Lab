# DS-DA-Lab

The subject **Data Science and Data Analytics Lab** was taken by me in my sixth semester. The studies were conducted in Python and R. <br> <br>
I have pushed all the required code here as future reference of sorts, except for the Day-1 codes, which dealt with Python and R basics. (The latter can be found in another of my repositories, <a href="https://github.com/rafi007akhtar/R-lab">here</a>.)

## Main topics include
<ul>
    <li> Basics of Python and R </li>
    <li> Scikit-learn in Python </li>
    <li> K-NearestNeighbor model and classifier building in Python </li>
    <li> Linear regression model building in R </li>
    <li>K-means clutering, and clusplots in R </li>
</ul>

## Working environments
• `Work-with-Python` diretory: Jupyter notebook <br>
• `Work-with-R` directory: Visual Studio Code (with R installed in the system) <br>
